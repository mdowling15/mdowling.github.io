  <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I am a freshman at Keene State College, I play hockey and softball.<br>
      I am a safety and occupational health applied sciences major. When im <br>
      older I want to have a nice house with a balcony and a skylight in the <br>
      master bedroom. The bathroom is going to have a marble bath tub and shower. <br>
      My girlfriend and I are going to have two kids and a bunch of dogs. She <br>
      said she won't let me buy a snake, but I'm going to get one anyways. We are <br>
      going to buy a house in Massachusetts, and my girlfriend might be coming to <br>
      Keene State. I am an only child, but I have 5 siblings; 1 half-brother and <br>
      four step siblings. My nana and I are best friends, I think she was more <br>
      sad than my mom when I left for college. I love sports, I actually play <br>
      hockey for the Keene State Women's Club Hockey team.
